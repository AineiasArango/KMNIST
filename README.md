# KMNIST
Just wanted to learn how to use a convolutional neural network in pytorch so used the KMNIST dataset to do so.
This code trains a convolutional neural network so it can recognise Japanese hiragana and puts it into one of ten groups. I didn't train it to do each individual letter as I figured it would take too much computational power for my laptop and it's just meant to be a casual mini project anyway.
